Welcome to my GitHub repo for the 8 Week SQL Challenge!

In this repository, you will find my solutions and progress for the 8 Week SQL Challenge. This challenge is designed to help me enhance my SQL skills through practical and engaging real-world scenarios. Over the course of eight weeks, I will be presented with various SQL tasks, each one building upon the previous challenge and progressively becoming more complex.

Throughout this journey, I will be working with a diverse range of data sets, modeling databases, and crafting SQL queries to extract valuable insights and solve intriguing problems. By completing these challenges, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of SQL concepts, improve my data analysis capabilities, and become more proficient in database management.

Feel free to explore the different folders and challenges within this repository to follow along with my progress and witness my growth as an SQL enthusiast. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome, as I am eager to learn and grow from this experience.

Thank you for joining me on this 8 Week SQL Challenge adventure, and I hope you find my solutions and thought processes informative and inspiring. Let's dive into the world of data manipulation, exploration, and analysis with SQL!
